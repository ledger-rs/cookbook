# Lots

Basic Ledger's documentation on the use of Lots is in the [Buying and Selling Stock](https://ledger-cli.org/doc/ledger3.html#Buying-and-Selling-Stock) section of the documentation.

Lots are used for the calculation of Capital Gain/Loss as they record the date and price of any lot of owned commodities. Usually the main reason for this is [Tax Lot Accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxlotaccounting.asp), or the governments' requirement to report Capital Gain/Loss and as it affects taxation.
